# azure-onboarding
This repo onboards customers to the aks by provisioning their azure infra resources as well as kubernetes resources and give them their namespace level access.
This uses uses terraform for infra provisioning like User Assigned Managed Identity, Federated Credential; uses helm charts to create namespace, service account, resource quotas, limit ranges, role and rolebindings. For CICD Pipeline we will use azure Devops.
